# DiceRoller-mtn-
Here I flex my JavaScript 'expertise' as I create an application which predicts possible winner from a  given data set.

# Instructions on how to use:
    -To run the application you need, Node package manager and have Serve installed(npm install --global serve), then use (serve -l 8000).
    -please open page inspect to view console.log results as some functions results are displayed there.
    -If an error appears after opening page inspect, please refresh page to get clean view.
    -when using the Dice button's, first you throw the dice then pick it up 'from the floor' to get clean new results.
    -To execute aim C, please navigate to models folder in your terminal then execute the command ('node win.js').

# The aim of this application is to :
    (A) Log user information, 
    (B)Roll a dice and predict which category will win the MTN Business App of the year Award 2022, 
    (C)Create, open, and read from a textfile.

# Learning's Diary :
    -How to create a GitHub repository then open it on VScode.
    -Style webpage using HTML,this is an achievment for me becuase one day,
        me:I very good at coding,
        An Experienced friend: Please change this button's color for me,
        me: Easy (oozing with confidence),
        random xhosa dude: i like your confindence,
        An Experienced friend: open's a project he is working on,
        me: ehhhh, the thing is..(explains himself out of a sticky situation)
        *moral of the story*: (I wanted to write something funny and deep here but it's taking too much time for me to come up with, so let me git commit&push. because i'm hungry i have to go eat)

# Community :
-This section is for sharing useful reasource's i found online which were helpful in me completing this project.
-I don't know if this has legal impications, as i technically will be sharing other peoples work but i think a big part of the tech community involves sharing of knowledge and helping other. 
*This is my Teach a men(genderless) to fish moment*
-I have been helped a lot in my journey and i aim to do the same, so sharing these links is me giving you something deeper than a finished product.
-I just thought that i should be able to share the music i was listening too while creating, it would be dope if VS Code had like that function to keep track of the songs you played while woring, since most developers like playing music while working. Just also realised that this is not an original idea since it happens in Discord, i have seen it there. 
-I was playing Sjava: Umsebenzi(Gold delux) 

This is actually a goal for me, goal reached(yay!!, yay!!)
