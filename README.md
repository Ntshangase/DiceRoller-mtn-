# DiceRoller-mtn-
Here I flex my JavaScript 'expertise' as I create an application which predicts possible winner from a  given data set.
I'm learning as I go, but the aim of this application is to :
    (A) Log user information, 
    (B)Roll a dice and predict which category will win the MTN Business App of the year Award 2022, 
    (C)Create, open, and read from a textfile.
I also aim to have this as a diary as I got hrough this learning process.
Things I learned :
    -How to create a GitHub repository then open it on vs studio.
This is actually a goal for me, goal reached(yay!!, yay!!)
