# DiceRoller-mtn-
Here I flex my JavaScript 'expertise' as I create an application which predicts possible winner from a  given data set.

# Instructions on how to use:
    -To run the application you need, Node package manager and have Serve installed(npm install --global serve), then use (serve -l 8000).
    -please open page inspect to view console.log results as some functions results are displayed there.
    -If an error appears after opening page inspect, please refresh page to get clean view.
    -when using the Dice button's, first you throw the dice then pick it up 'from the floor' to get clean new results.

# The aim of this application is to :
    (A) Log user information, 
    (B)Roll a dice and predict which category will win the MTN Business App of the year Award 2022, 
    (C)Create, open, and read from a textfile.

# Learning's Diary :
    -How to create a GitHub repository then open it on VScode.
    -Style webpage using HTML,this is an achievment for me becuase one day,
        me:I very good at coding,
        An Experienced friend: Please change this button's color for me,
        me: Easy (oozing with confidence),
        random xhosa dude: i like your confindence,
        An Experienced friend: open's a project he is working on,
        me: ehhhh, the thing is..(explains himself out of a sticky situation)
        *moral of the story*: (I wanted to write something funny and deep here but it's taking too much time for me to come up with, so let me git commit&push. because i'm hungry i have to go eat)

This is actually a goal for me, goal reached(yay!!, yay!!)
